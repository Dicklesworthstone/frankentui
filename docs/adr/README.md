# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory records decisions that are likely to be controversial later, or that we want to lock to avoid churn.

Format:
- Context
- Decision
- Alternatives considered
- Consequences
- Test plan / verification

ADRs should be short, opinionated, and operational.
